    "## Reference \n",
    "_Fine-Scale Inference of Ancestry Segments Without Prior Knowledge of Admixing Groups_ Salter-Townshend, M. and Myers, S.R. \n",
    "    **Genetics** (2019): [10.1534/genetics.119.302139](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.119.302139)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a result browser on $95$ human populations see <https://maths.ucd.ie/~mst/MOSAIC/HGDP_browser/>. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "MOSAIC is a tool for modelling multiway admixture using dense genotype data. \n",
    "Given a set of potentially admixed haplotypes (targets) and multiple labelled sets of potentially related haplotypes (panels), \n",
    "MOSAIC will infer the most recent admixture events occurring in the targets in terms of the panels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is not necessary that any of the panels are good direct surrogates for the unseen mixing populations** as MOSAIC will infer parameters controlling:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recombination rates before and after admixture ($\\rho$ and $\\Pi$ respectively). \n",
    "\n",
    "* The stochastic relationship between panels and ancestral populations ($\\mu$). \n",
    "   \n",
    "* Timings (from coancestry curves) and ancestry proportions ($\\alpha$) of the admixture events.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mutation / error rates for the haplotypes ($\\theta$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Phasing improvements in light of the admixture model are performed and **local ancestry along the genome** is estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please read the README.txt packaged with MOSAIC for additional information.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs / Data\n",
    "The `example_data` folder packaged with MOSAIC contains example human data for chromosomes 18 to 22.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examination of the files** in the `example_data` folder should make the format of each of the below clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As inputs MOSAIC requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Phased haplotypes for reference panels and target (admixed) individuals (MOSAIC attempts to detect and correct phasing errors in targets): \n",
    "these should be named `pop.genofile.chr` where pop is the population (panel) name and chr is the chromosome index.  \n",
    "All entries should be $0,1,?$ indicating ref, alt, or missing entries respectively. The rows are \\#snps and the columns are \\#haps. \n",
    "**Note that there should be no spaces in these files.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A population names file: `sample.names` format unimportant apart from first column should have all the population names.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SNP files: `snpfile.chr` with \\#snps rows and 6 columns comprising rsID, chr, distance, position, allele ?, allele ?. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Recombination rates files: `rates.chr` 3 rows of \\#sites, position, cumulative recombination rate (in centiMorgans). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs / Results\n",
    "- A folder called `MOSAIC_RESULTS` is required to hold log-files (foo.out) and results (foo.RData).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- A folder called `MOSAIC_PLOTS` is required to hold the plots created by default by a MOSAIC run.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A folder called `FREQS` is required to hold the frequencies used to compute $F_{st}$ statistics if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above will be created on Linux systems as required if not present. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters Inferred\n",
    "There are 4 sets of parameters inferred via EM:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\Pi$: prob. of switching between latent ancestries, including switch to same anc; dimension $A\\times A$ where $A$ is the number of mixing groups.\n",
    "1. $\\rho$: prob. of switching haps within each ancestry; scalar.\n",
    "1. $\\mu$: copying matrix; $\\mu_{ia}$ is  the probability of a donor from group i given ancestry a; dimension $K\\times A$ where K is \\#donorpops. \n",
    "1. $\\theta$: prob. of a difference b/w copied and copying haps at a locus; scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "See reference for details. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Simple Simulation Study\n",
    "The following demonstrates MOSAIC via a quick and simple simulation that takes about 5 minutes to run, \n",
    "involving 2-way admixture between English and Mandenkan genomes $30$ generations ago in approximately equal proportions\n",
    "on chromosomes $18$ to $22$. \n",
    "When the seed is set in *R* as below, identical results and plots should be obtained."
